## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Abdalla, a Web Developer student passionate about building meaningful digital experiences that help people.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced backend logic with NestJS and exploring privacy-first design patterns. Along with trying to master React and build creative interfaces!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that combine clean UI with ethical tech â€” especially in education, social good, or accessibility.


ðŸ’¬ Ask me about TypeScript, React, UX design, privacy-first apps.
